# FIX LIST

-   the way the frame 'jumps' when a selection is clicked ✅ _FIXED_
-   'Round 6' appearing if one of the panels is clicked after the game is over, whilst the 'PLAY AGAIN' button is shown ✅ _FIXED_
-   Mobile friendly version as a media-query.
-   Show computer versus player picks in a less perfunctory way. I.e., some kind of display/animation phase for the rock-paper-scissors faceoffs.
-   Graphic for the title
-   Light background music for the main event, with an on/off toggle
